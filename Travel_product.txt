The website can track the number of impressions (i.e., the number of times an ad is displayed), the click-through rate (i.e., the percentage of users who click on the ad), and the cost per impression or cost per click to optimize their pricing model and increase revenue.

Hybrid model: A combination of the above metrics can be used to evaluate the profitability of this model. For example, the website can track the revenue generated from commissions and subscriptions, as well as the revenue generated from advertising.
